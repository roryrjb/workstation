## Quirks

I usually just target the latest Ubuntu release, and if that's an LTS there's
usually good support from external vendors _except_ when an LTS has just been
released. Otherwise I am currently tracking the latest non-LTS release, so depending
on timing, I may hardcode certain release names in roles.
