## Quirks

I usually just target the latest Ubuntu release, and if that's an LTS there's
usually good support from external vendors except when an LTS has just been
released or I am currently tracking the latest non-LTS release, so depending
on timing, I may hardcode the last LTS release or last release that has support
release name on certain roles.
